# Wist — Smart Wishlist & Price Tracker

> Wist is a free smart wishlist and price tracking app that lets you save products from any online store, track price drops automatically, and share your wishlist with friends and family.

## What is Wist?

Wist is a modern wishlist manager and price tracker for online shoppers. Instead of keeping bookmarks or spreadsheets, Wist lets you save products from any website in one click using a Chrome extension, then automatically monitors prices and notifies you when they drop.

## Key Features

- **Universal Wishlist**: Save products from Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Etsy, and any online store — all in one place.
- **Automatic Price Tracking**: Wist checks prices daily and keeps a full price history chart for every item.
- **Price Drop Alerts**: Get notified instantly when a product's price drops so you never miss a deal.
- **Chrome Extension**: One-click saving from any product page while you browse. No copy-pasting URLs.
- **Smart Collections**: Organize items into custom collections with auto-categorization.
- **Shareable Wishlists**: Share your wishlist via a public link — perfect for gift registries, birthdays, and holidays.
- **Free to Use**: Core features are completely free. No credit card required.
